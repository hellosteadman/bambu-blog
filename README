Bambu Blog
==========

A simple set of models for a basic blog, with some tools for
custom-designed blog post writing

About Bambu Blog
----------------

Bambu Blog was originally intended as a simple blogging tool for web
apps, that allowed developers to quickly setup a blog for their app
based on a common Bootstrap template, without needing to manage another
site and set of user accounts. It used Markdown to render text-only
copy, and `Bambu
Attachments <https://github.com/iamsteadman/bambu-attachments>`_ to
handle uploading images and other media.

It's grown a little since then, and now supports either the
`MarkItUp <https://bitbucket.org/carljm/django-markitup/src>`_ or
`TinyMCE <https://github.com/aljosa/django-tinymce>`_ editors (just
install the Django app you want and Bambu Blog will detect it and apply
the appropriate class names to the main body textbox).

Installation
------------

Install the package via Pip:

::

    pip install bambu-blog

Add it to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list:

::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'bambu_blog'
    )

Add ``bambu_blog.urls`` to your URLconf:

::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^blog/', include('bambu_blog.urls')),
    )

Run ``manage.py syncdb`` or ``manage.py migrate`` to setup the database
tables.

Basic usage
-----------

The blog uses a number of templates. All of the important ones extend
``blog/base.html``, so you should start by overriding that template to
set it up how you like it. The naming convention used throughout the
Bambu collection of apps designates the main content area via the Jinja
block ``form_content``. A block is already defined called ``sidebar``,
so you can either place HTML in there or override
``blog/sidebar.inc.html``.

Add a blog post via the admin area of your site. As you're logged in as
a staff member you don't have to publish the blog post to be able to see
it on the site once saved. View the blog post index at /blog/.

Override the ``blog/post.html`` template to tweak the display of the
blog post.
